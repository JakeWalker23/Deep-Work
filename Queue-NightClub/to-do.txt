So far: 

Implemented a simple Queue Class

Added basic markup for UI.

To Do:

Style everything so its nice and positioned nicely.

Add buttons that dynamically affect the Queue. (In JS)

Add responsiveness (IF time)

Still to do:

Each member of the Queue is a party of that amount. i.e 4 is a group of 4 and therefore should update the total as such. 

Bit of defensive programming to error handle.

* Error handle the add button, so that a value must be present.

* Music playing when the club has 1 person. Stop when club is empty.

If Current capaity > club capacity, club is full
    Therefore you cant add more people untill they are removed.
